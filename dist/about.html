          <p>
            My name is Syeda Ahmed. I was born and raised in Pakistan, so I
            speak Urdu in addition to English. I believe in hard work and
            learning, and these are values I have exemplified since the
            beginning of my career. I was among the 0.5% of outstanding students
            in the U.S. for 3 years in a row and have always prided myself in
            the work I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my personal life, I am dedicated to my family, in particular, my
            son. I studied computer Science concentrating in Database and Data
            Analysis from DePaul University. Right after graduation, I got a job
            at Abbott Laboratories. After having my son, I decided to stay at
            home with him full-time. I love cooking, learning new recipes, and
            volunteering. I volunteer for STEM scout classes at my son's school,
            for example.
          </p>
          <p>
            A love for cooking runs in the family as I also support my uncle's
            pizza place by running the Facebook page for the business
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mamamariapizza/" target="new"
              >Mama Maria Pizza & More.</a
            >
            Now as I see my son has grown up and needs me not as much, I am
            willing to pursue my career again. I have always been passionate
            about the field of technology and I am always learning something new
            to ensure that my skills are up-to-date. I also hold a certificate
            in Bio Information System.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I am not just involved with computers! Sharing knowledge and
            skills is very important for me. I have a motivational page on
            Facebook,
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/theglassis" target="new"
              >The Glass is Half Full</a
            >
            , followed by thousands of people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Quality matters to me in everything I do, be it programming or
            cooking a delicious new recipe. I am a certified full-stack web
            developer from Northwestern University and am constantly updating
            myself with a variety of programming languages and tools in demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also working on a product called
            <a href="https://www.tutorsloop.net/" target="new">Tutors Loop</a>
            with a team of exceptional developers. The platform connects
            students and tutors from across the world with a secure payment
            system. I hope soon it will provide a comfortable space for the
            users to continue learning whatever they want from people around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My professional experience includes different positions. I have
            worked in data management, scientific analysis (integrating Computer
            Science, Mathematics, Database programming, and Design),
            bioengineering, pharmaceuticals, and tech support. In these
            positions, I was able to acquire different skills, associated with
            IT, communication, development, and others. I would say that the
            greatest skill I have is adaptableness. I can easily learn new
            things and new technologies, always trying to gain new skills, and
            also can adapt to a variety of positions, as my work history
            indicates.
